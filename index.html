            <h1>Hi, I'm Vanesa Aguay</h1>
            <h2>★</h2>
            <p> As a freshman at Wyomissing Area High School, I do my best to get involved around <br>
                my community. Through many experiences, I have been able to meet wonderful<br> people as well as find 
                out what I am truly passionate about.

<!----ABOUT----->
<section class="about" id="about me">
    <h1>about me</h1>
    <div class="pic"> <img src="../idk/headshot.png"> </div>
    <p>Being from an Ecuadorian family has not only given me the gift of being bilingual but also the ability to experience two very distinct cultures. My dual identities 
        have played a significant role in my life, teaching me lessons not many can experience. It has also driven me to want to break barriers in underrepresented roles,
        such as pursing a career in STEM. Along with many other reasons, STEM has always interested me, from conducting the classic vinegar and baking soda experiment
        at six years old to now being be a part of groups that revolve around STEM. Looking back to my elementary school years, I was constantly building and designing, whether 
        it was a cardboard robot hand that could move with strings or starting a small business on Redbubble when I was ten. Combining both my passions, I became interested in
        biomedical engineering. As I grow throughout high school, I hope to find more opportunities to be involved in more STEM roles!</p>

    <p>Leadership is more than just being a guide, it is also to empower those around you. I strive to inspire others to be their best selves.
    I lead with empathy and understanding, recognizing each person's unique strengths and challenges. Through my leadership roles, I have 
    learned the importance of good communication and collaboration.</p>
